<strong>ETERNAL FLOW</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Annotation by ChatGPT</strong></p>
<p>At the heart of the philosophical and spiritual allegory <em>Eternal
Flow</em> is the journey of self-discovery and transformation of an
immortal being who must navigate the hardships of human existence.
From a divine fall into the mortal world to the attainment of inner
freedom, the protagonist, Eternal Flow, faces the inevitability of
fate and the search for the true meaning of life. Along his path, he
encounters a Teacher who not only reveals profound philosophical
truths but also helps him realize that the journey toward
self-understanding and inner balance is impossible without accepting
his own fate. By practicing Eastern martial arts and philosophical
teachings, Eternal Flow finds strength within himself, overcoming
karma and freeing himself from inner conflicts. The book explores
essential questions of karma, free will, humility, and inner harmony.
The author poses an important question: how can one achieve true
freedom by accepting their fate? <em>Eternal Flow</em> is a story of
self-search and finding strength in acceptance, inspiring anyone
seeking their own path in life.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Fall</strong></p>
<p>It is difficult to say what kind of being Eternal Flow was. From
the perspective of a simple mortal living on Earth, he would probably
be called a Celestial Being. However, within the realm of &quot;Celestial
Beings,&quot; where each entity had a clearly defined role in
maintaining universal harmony and balance, he was not accepted as one
of them due to his vaguely expressed duties and his lack of
subordination to any higher powers. The defining feature of Eternal
Flow, from which his name originated, was his hypersensitivity,
manifested in his ability to detect unnatural things, phenomena, or
tendencies produced by other celestial beings at an early stage,
which in turn allowed him to avoid excesses in the celestial system
that governed the material worlds. The &quot;system&quot; itself
never encroached upon Eternal Flow's freedoms; any slight external
tension could distort his sensitivity, akin to misaligning a
high-precision instrument, after which its value would be entirely
lost. However, the &quot;system&quot; was hardly guided by altruistic
motives. On the contrary, it was extremely rigid and, in essence,
totalitarian, in the sense that it had no alternatives and could
never have any. The only reason Eternal Flow was able to maintain his
special status was the supreme principle of self-regulation that
exists in the universe: the principle of free will, which no system
can bypass. There is no force that can violate this principle.
Whether they be humans or gods, they agree to various forms of
slavery in exchange for feeding their illusions about how the world
is arranged. Some are caught in the illusion that no choice exists
except the one between different kinds of slavery; others are
deceived by the very illusion of choice where none truly exists.
These are all techniques of mind control, but they work only as long
as they are voluntarily accepted. Motives do not matter; only consent
does.</p>
<p>The world in which Eternal Flow lived had neither time nor space
in the usual sense, and the most accurate metric to describe the
existence he and the celestial system lived in would be density. It
could not be said that something happened within a specific time and
place. Rather, it could be described as an increase or decrease in
density in certain areas of existence. But even the word &quot;areas&quot;
is not entirely accurate—it is more like different types of
densities, as if they were made of different materials. On the
material level, these densities manifest as various forms of organic
and inorganic life within the context of their life cycles—what we
know as the material world with its space and time. The unique
hypersensitivity possessed by Eternal Flow allowed him to register
changes in the Universal Density. The natural process appeared as a
continuous flow of densities within their opposites: when density
reaches its peak, it changes polarity, becoming its opposite. This is
a highly dynamic process. It might also appear chaotic. The Celestial
Authority precisely considers it chaotic, which justifies its own
existence. Celestial beings try to impose order on this &quot;chaos,&quot;
which on the material level leads to the creation of entire worlds.
The main problem they face is the lack of feedback, or rather, its
absence. Naturally, world creation is an energy-consuming process,
and in the early stages, it is very difficult to determine whether
the strategy chosen is correct. It is like a game of Go, where
players place black and white stones on a board in order to capture
more territory than the opponent. In Go, the player with a deeper
strategy, supported by a precise calculation of options, wins. The
same is true in the creation of worlds. There is a saying: &quot;Go
is a game of the gods.&quot; The only difference is that instead of
placing stones on a board, they place stars in the sky. The essence
is the same—the embodiment of naturalness in material forms; the
difference lies in the scale of consequences and responsibility. When
the gods made a particular &quot;move,&quot; Eternal Flow instantly
sensed whether it made sense and whether it would work as intended.
The result of his &quot;perception&quot; was a corresponding
&quot;background&quot;—changes in density translated into a coarser
and more understandable form for the gods, so that they could see how
reasonable and viable their ideas and plans were.</p>
<p>The one who speaks well listens poorly; the one who listens well
speaks poorly. These are matters of balancing action and perception.
The one who maintains this balance changes endlessly; the one who
loses it falls into a cruder form and risks losing themselves.<br/>
Free
will has two sides: the possibility of living outside the system and
the temptation to subjugate the entire system to oneself. The first
leads to absolute freedom, the second to a torturous existence that
ends with becoming the system itself. This is worse than ultimate
annihilation. Deviating from the path is the only way to deepen one's
understanding of it. This is why celestial beings often desire to
incarnate on the material plane, as it is the only way to evolve.
However, not all do this consciously. Eternal Flow fell into two
traps simultaneously. On one hand, he thought there was no other
choice but to create or not create worlds. As his density
accumulated, he unknowingly became a &quot;regime opponent,&quot;
genuinely believing that the absence of world-creation by the gods
was better than having such a practice. On the other hand, he
believed that the gods' choices were dictated by their free will, not
their inherent nature. Unlike other celestial beings, Eternal Flow
had no one who could provide him with feedback. Meanwhile, his
delusions continued to grow stronger. The situation escalated to the
point where the gods began seriously doubting his assessments.</p>
<p>For the first time in his existence, Eternal Flow encountered
bias, which clouded the purity of his heart's direct perception. As
often happens, we notice deviations from the path too late, when the
opportunity to retrace our steps is already gone. The only option
left in such a case is to take the &quot;long spiral,&quot; fully
experiencing the consequences of the law of cause and effect, known
as &quot;karma.&quot; Karma is a form of responsibility that, whether
gods or humans, beings begin to bear the moment they allow themselves
to believe they can control the natural process. This happens
unnoticed. Over time, we begin to feel strange sensations within
ourselves that were not there before. The first thing Eternal Flow
felt was... the absence of flow, of movement, of dynamics. He still
thought he &quot;felt&quot; it, but in reality, it was a lack of
sensitivity. For a moment, he suddenly believed he had &quot;figured
out&quot; everything about what the world is and how it exists. He
thought he could now control this world as he controlled himself...
But wait, himself? After all, he had never before felt a separation
between &quot;the world&quot; and &quot;himself.&quot; This new
sensation drew him deeper and deeper into the vortex of no return.</p>
<p>Falling &quot;from heaven to earth&quot; is not a process of
moving from above to below. Although the overloads experienced by a
meteorite flying through the upper layers of the atmosphere are
comparable to those a celestial being undergoes when &quot;falling&quot;
to the material plane, it is more like psychological pressure than
physical. At the moment of &quot;falling,&quot; there is no physical
body as such. For the psyche, there is no difference between birth
and death—both are perceived as the final and irrevocable end of
everything that came before. Eternal Flow had not yet realized that
he was &quot;falling&quot; onto the material plane of existence; his
consciousness was still engrossed in exploring new sensations, and
the terror of what was happening was perceived merely as curiosity
for the time being. At some point, the tension became so overwhelming
that the richness of various sensations was replaced by a single
feeling of universal expansion. In the world, there are only two
forces—centripetal and centrifugal. One gives life, the other
brings death, but what constitutes life and death depends on one's
perspective. From the viewpoint of the Celestial Realm, where Eternal
Flow resided, what was happening to him now was undoubtedly death. He
was on the verge of losing everything he had once and for all—for
even the &quot;long spiral&quot; of karma offers no guarantees of a
&quot;successful return.&quot; Moreover, those who embark on this
path inevitably die in the Celestial Realm at the moment of
&quot;falling,&quot; just as an ordinary person dies from the
perspective of others on Earth. The transition from the Celestial
Realm to the conditionally &quot;Earthly&quot; occurs through
centrifugal force, hence the sensation of unbearable expansion. In
general, the very sensation of a physical body, as well as its
existence, is the result of the continuous action of centrifugal
force. Laundry spinning in a washing machine during the spin cycle
feels its &quot;weight&quot; precisely due to centrifugal force—it
is literally pressed against the drum walls. The process of dying in
the Celestial Realm and being born in the &quot;Earthly&quot; occurs
by the same principle. The process of dying in the &quot;Earthly&quot;
world and being born in the Celestial happens through the opposite
force—centripetal. However, this does not mean that, being on
Earth, one necessarily dies &quot;to heaven&quot; and vice versa.
Existence is a multidimensional structure, where changes in karma
during life determine the further direction of development or
degradation. Thus, heaven and hell, while they can be understood as
specific places, are more comparable to directions of movement. Earth
is a vivid example of this, and whether it is heaven or hell depends
on where one arrives from—&quot;above&quot; or &quot;below.&quot;
For Eternal Flow, Earth was definitely the most terrifying hell
imaginable. The time spent there, given the complete loss of his
Density, equaled eternity, for until the Density was restored, there
could be no question of returning. And this eternity could last for
more than one human lifetime.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Birth</strong></p>
<p>A person or deity &quot;falls&quot; only as far as necessary to
recognize their mistakes. Pointing out mistakes externally is
meaningless; only realization that comes from within can lead to true
transformation. It is said that memory is completely erased before
birth. This is both true and false. Birth into the earthly world is
an extremely turbulent process, so what happens to &quot;memory&quot;
is akin to what occurs after an ordinary accident: it may temporarily
vanish. However, this is the wrong way to think about memory as a
linear sequence of events throughout a lifetime. The only true memory
that remains is the memory of Density, or the memory of Density
itself.</p>
<p>The memory of the details of a specific incarnation is generally
irrelevant because the only thing that counts is the relative changes
in Density over the course of life. We enter life with a certain
reserve and quality of Density, and the question is simply what will
change as a result of that life: either we deplete the reserve and
diminish its quality, or we enhance it and transform it into a more
refined form. Density accumulates through the increase in the
frequency of its vibration or disperses as this frequency decreases.
The physical plane is not something opposed to the spiritual—it is
merely a coarser, more manifest, more primitive world where
disruptions to the natural course of things are felt as pain.</p>
<p>The preservation and multiplication of Density is not a linear
process; it is always a process of transformation. At birth, we
receive a certain reserve of life force—a projection of our
original Density. This can be measured in years of life, and its
nature and quality determine the destiny of the form we take in this
world. Life force will inevitably run out, and the form will die once
and for all; with it, its memory will die too. Personality is a kind
of glue that fuses the original Density with a particular form, such
as a human one, so that Density perceives the physical body as
itself. This is necessary for deep internal work to occur. Density
that can freely leave and re-enter the body while feeling independent
of it cannot be considered embodied, as the main task of
embodiment—internal transformation—is not fulfilled.</p>
<p>The desire to achieve physical immortality is as absurd as a
rocket booster wishing to fly forever instead of releasing its
payload into orbit. This simply indicates the rocket booster's total
misunderstanding of its nature and purpose.</p>
<p>Life force can be transformed into mental resilience. This is an
imprecise term; it would be more accurate to say that life force can
be transformed into something that feels like deep and stable
psychological or moral resilience, unshaken by the upheavals of this
world. However, moral resilience cannot be taken to the grave.
Although the mechanism for building it from scratch may persist
somewhere, it is ultimately just a condensed reserve of the same life
force. What can be &quot;taken with you&quot; is what is called
Spirit. The process of transforming moral resilience into Spirit can
be likened to the distillation of moonshine—moral resilience is
like the mash from which the spirit is extracted. The subsequent
purification of the spirit is essentially no different from the
process of &quot;spiritual cleansing.&quot; When Spirit reaches the
peak of its purity, it transforms into Emptiness, and a process of
pulsation begins. This manifests as continuous transitions between
the states of Emptiness and the form of Spirit, back and forth. This
is known as the &quot;breath of the universe.&quot; It is a natural
process that happens on its own—there is no point in dwelling on it
or trying to understand it.</p>
<p>Eternal Flow suddenly realized with horror what was happening to
him. When a child is born, the critical moment is when air enters the
lungs for the first time. If this does not happen, the child dies. It
is like a final chance to avoid embodiment. Eternal Flow clung
desperately to his fetal existence, in which he had unknowingly spent
the past nine months—it at least remotely resembled the life he had
lived before, something familiar. But now he had to take a step into
the external world. No words can describe how much he did not want to
take that step. Even the crystal-clear awareness that continuing to
fall into lower planes of existence would become increasingly costly
with each descent did not motivate him to take his first breath.</p>
<p>But he was forced to. Whether it was the doctors resuscitating him
or Higher Forces, it was, in any case, the first and perhaps the most
painful time Eternal Flow experienced violence against him—violence
that, at the time, he felt was utterly unavoidable.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Awakening</strong></p>
<p>The moment when Density fully recovers from the process of birth
and first attains wholeness is called self-awareness. For most
people, this does not happen even after countless lifetimes. This was
one of the main reasons Eternal Flow was not a supporter of the Gods
experimenting with the creation of ever-new worlds. It is hardly
surprising that his very presence in a creation he considered
fundamentally flawed did little to inspire loyalty. Eternal Flow
recovered from his “birth” relatively quickly—his ancient
Density was cohesive and strong enough that self-awareness in the new
reality came without much difficulty. The problem lay elsewhere: a
universal rejection of the situation in which he found himself. The
rage born of his helplessness and inability to return to his former
state clouded the purity of his heart’s direct perception. Indeed,
this was the same flaw that had led to his incarnation on Earth, and
as it turned out, it had not gone away. Worse yet, here, it seemed
magnified under a cosmic lens.</p>
<p>Eternal Flow saw and understood everything but was powerless to
act. If he considered life on Earth a punishment, then childhood was
its cruelest manifestation. On Earth, as in other projects of the
Gods, the central idea is what is prettily called “the development
and betterment of the world.” It so happens that anything
artificially created, rather than arising naturally, inevitably seeks
self-control through expansion. Just as the Gods cannot comprehend
their nature except through the creation of worlds, humans are doomed
to create social systems aimed at examining their own vices. As a
result, everything a child is taught from birth amounts to how to
devour their own kind. For those who either lack self-awareness or
know no alternative, this seems perfectly normal. Moreover, many
people manage to carry fond memories of a “joyful and carefree”
childhood throughout their lives.</p>
<p>The only requirement to “succeed” on Earth is to align with
the guiding principle that has shaped its civilizations across all
ages: outward expansion. In doing so, one ensures endless,
meaningless reincarnations almost indefinitely. Wars, epidemics,
natural disasters, and oppressive regimes come later. For now, a
child will merely be labeled an idiot and subjected to relentless
socialization until their individual intellectual abilities regress
to the level of an average citizen. Afterward, personal control is no
longer necessary, as the technologies of mass mind control take over
with ease and certainty. The type of political regime under which
this occurs is irrelevant; as long as freedom is mistaken for the
voluntary exchange of one form of servitude for another, escape is
impossible. There is little difference between the material comfort
slavery of capitalist Western societies and the ideological or
criminal control in authoritarian states in the East. Few understand
that enslaved minds and empty pockets share the same root: the desire
for expansion. Indeed, the concept of expansion has supplanted the
concept of freedom, as if possessing greater material wealth or
influence could serve as its substitute. It is akin to prisoners
aspiring to rise through the ranks to become wardens, failing to see
that the very existence of the prison is the source of their misery.</p>
<p>Slavery is always a mutual process; moreover, a master depends on
a slave more than the slave depends on the master, for the master has
something to lose, while the slave does not. Strangely, no one seems
to consider the idea that the existence of an artificially created
world inherently negates the possibility of freedom. Such a system
can only exist through the most severe control and violence. Gods are
preoccupied with the necessity of creating worlds, while humans are
consumed with justifying the necessity of governance. In ancient
times, the right to rule was at least tied to divine authority, which
was logical and somewhat functional. Today, democracy has been
invented to justify the right to rule through the will of the people,
as if they were the source of power. Oddly enough, even such absurd
distortions are part of the nature of things. This form is not new—it
is simply in an advanced state of decay. Unfortunately, during his
childhood in a human body, Eternal Flow was unable to grasp this.
Even if he could, he was not ready to accept it.</p>
<p>Above all, Eternal Flow wanted to know the truth. He earnestly
sought to understand the reality he had entered, study its laws, and
find a way back. However, the very premise of his quest was flawed:
one cannot return—one can only transform along a directed path. The
desire to change the world in which one lives is no different from
wanting to immigrate to a developed country in search of a “better
life”—just another illusion that comes at a high cost. Despite
his misconceptions and his frail body, weak from birth, Eternal Flow
maintained unwavering certainty in his correctness on every issue.
This often backfired and was, in fact, the original cause of his
fall. Yet, on Earth, it served as an effective, albeit costly,
defense. This defense involved mental strain bordering on the loss of
sanity but provided resilience against the destructive effects of the
external world. It was during this time that he first formulated his
life’s goal: to learn how to interact with the external world. Much
later, when he finally achieved this, he realized that the goal was
false. However, there are no absolutely right or wrong goals—only
those that are appropriate or inappropriate for a given stage of
one’s life journey.</p>
<p>The choice of freedom is not a one-time act; it is a daily effort
directed against the entire global system. When this choice is made
consistently over many years, the shackles binding a person from
birth begin to loosen. Standard forms of slavery are typically
offered in the guise of a “beloved job” or “prestigious
societal status.” Curiously, the practical incompatibility of these
two ideals seems to bother no one. Nor does anyone mention the
possibility that one might someday be sent to die in a war for these
and other values, which were never truly one’s own. Everything has
a price, even the acceptance of seemingly “correct” values, but
no one speaks of this. Perhaps the understanding of cause-and-effect
relationships is a forbidden ability on Earth—or, more accurately,
not forbidden but stigmatized by society. After all, why prohibit
something when public opinion can simply be shaped as desired?</p>
<p>In any case, Eternal Flow began to feel less of the despair of his
insignificant existence and more of his own unchanging nature, which
had remained intact despite his “fall” into a human body.
Initially, he became casually interested in Eastern martial arts, but
the deeper he delved, the more the practical aspects faded into the
background, giving way to cultural and philosophical dimensions. He
sought a way to view himself not within the entirety of life but
within a smaller, enclosed world governed solely by natural laws,
devoid of social constructs. His study of Eastern philosophy
validated many conclusions he had reached through the painful
experiences of his short life. However, living in harmony with these
principles proved elusive. People around him tried to convince him
that it was technically impossible within the socio-cultural
environment he inhabited. Yet, he refused to believe such nonsense,
understanding instead that he simply had not yet found the person who
could show him that it was possible.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Teacher</strong></p>
<p>Amid all the noise Eternal Flow had been subjected to throughout
his childhood, one idea managed to bypass his inner censorship: <em>The
Teacher appears when the student is ready.</em> By that time, he was
already familiar with the concept of transmitting the &quot;true
tradition,&quot; where, unlike conventional learning, the emphasis is
on passing the mastery of life <em>from heart to heart</em>. To pass
something on, however, one must first possess it. Eternal Flow sought
someone who could demonstrate how the principles and laws of Eastern
philosophy—particularly Chinese—manifested within the human body.
By the age of 17 in his earthly life, he had already spent years
practicing with enthusiasts of so-called &quot;internal&quot; martial
arts styles. However, it was akin to a blind man leading the lame.
Even setting aside the mediocre skill level of those he'd
encountered, his main grievance with his partners in &quot;pushing
hands&quot;—a paired exercise to develop sensitivity to an
opponent's movements—was their approach. They treated practice as
something separate from life. Some understood that practice and life
should be a unified whole but couldn't integrate this into their
daily reality. Others didn’t bother with the concept at all. There
were even those who tried to adapt the practice to better fit their
lives. While this last approach seemed somewhat absurd, it was at
least the most honest. Eternal Flow’s Teacher kindly referred to
such people as &quot;folk craftsmen.&quot;</p>
<p>Eternal Flow had a natural talent for forms—structured sequences
of movements, each embodying a specific metaphysical concept. Yet, he
could neither fully grasp these inner concepts nor apply them to
daily life. By then, he was familiar with numerous forms organized
into entire styles. He gravitated toward &quot;internal&quot; styles
characterized by slow, deliberate movements imbued with deep meaning.
Unfortunately, the deeper essence of these forms eluded him. It was
clear that each style affected his Density in unique ways, but this
influence remained superficial. Perhaps his greatest struggle was
that the flow of Density, which he could faintly perceive during solo
forms, would vanish completely during &quot;pushing hands&quot;
practice. Eternal Flow was overly eager to &quot;apply&quot; what he
sensed in solo forms, but this had the opposite effect. These were
echoes of the original mistake that had brought him to this time,
this place, and this body.</p>
<p>A Teacher is needed to help align the inner transformation of
Density with the external world. The &quot;true tradition&quot; is a
methodology for implementing this alignment in one’s life. However,
the nature of this methodology operates on a plane beyond rational
understanding. To control something, one must stand a level above it.
Thus, to exist in harmony with one’s natural essence in the
external world, one must rise above it. But to ascend, one must first
descend; to move right, one must first move left; to succeed, one
must care about the process, not the result. In practice, this is
achieved through relaxation and stillness. The question is how to
accomplish this. A Teacher is required to demonstrate it through the
example of their life. This is not a matter of understanding but of
experiencing.</p>
<p>Destiny is determined by the character of one’s inner nature,
not by social origins. Therefore, studying one’s nature is the key
to understanding one’s destiny and purpose. Eternal Flow met his
Teacher by chance. The chain of people, events, and circumstances
leading to this encounter defied common sense; according to all
rational logic, it should never have happened.</p>
<p>The Teacher held lessons outdoors, on Sunday mornings at 8 a.m.,
in the yard of an ordinary middle school—a highly unusual
occurrence for the time and place of these events. The moment Eternal
Flow first encountered the Teacher became forever etched in his
heart. For the first time, he could clearly articulate what he was
seeking and the qualities a true Teacher must possess. Unlike the
&quot;folk craftsmen&quot; Eternal Flow had dealt with before, the
Teacher did not engage in &quot;pushing hands.&quot; He never
competed with anyone. Instead, he simply demonstrated how Density
naturally flowed between his body and those of his students,
sometimes eliciting the most unpredictable movements within them. It
was more akin to a puppeteer animating marionettes than any form of
competition seen in &quot;pushing hands.&quot; This was an entirely
different level.</p>
<p>Eternal Flow wasn’t so much astonished by what he <em>saw</em>—similar
feats could be found in videos of Chinese masters—but by what he
<em>felt</em>. In the Teacher's presence, his Density seamlessly
united with his body, creating a single, harmonious flow. It felt
like an incredible inner lightness, something he hadn’t experienced
since his descent into a human form. For the first time, he
encountered something that unmistakably belonged to the realm he had
come from. It was beyond extraordinary. What made it even more
astonishing was how effortlessly the Teacher demonstrated his
mastery. To send people flying several meters or twist their arms, no
physical effort was required—only the same forms Eternal Flow
already knew. Yet in the Teacher’s presence, the forms came alive.
Eternal Flow's rational mind struggled to accept what was happening,
often dismissing it as an illusion or attributing it to the students’
cooperation. However, he <em>knew</em> the students weren’t playing
along. He could <em>see</em> it. And whenever he himself attempted to
attack the Teacher, his strength vanished into a void, leaving him
sprawled on the ground before he even realized what had occurred.
This was straightforward and unquestionable. What truly baffled
Eternal Flow was when, through the Teacher’s guidance, Density
passed through him, enabling <em>him</em> to influence the bodies of
others with seemingly no effort. He couldn’t believe it was
possible. The ease of it defied everything he had assumed. Eternal
Flow had always suspected that the forms carried more potential than
he could imagine, but he had underestimated their depth. He had
believed in a mysterious &quot;internal energy&quot; that
complemented the forms, only to discover that the true depth lay
within the forms themselves. The question was not whether the forms
held power, but how profoundly they operated.</p>
<p>The euphoria lasted for about three years before the flaw that had
brought Eternal Flow into this world began to resurface. The presence
of a Teacher alone could not resolve karmic debts—it merely
revealed one’s nature more deeply and provided tools to navigate
it. What Eternal Flow thought he was learning and what he was
<em>actually</em> learning were two entirely different things. He
believed he was uncovering the &quot;secrets of internal styles,&quot;
but in reality, he was learning to work with and accept himself as he
was. The Teacher often said, <em>“You must befriend yourself.”
</em>Work, the Teacher explained, was the ability to direct effort
toward a single purpose over a long period. Acceptance was the
capacity to maintain clarity and calm when work faltered or failed.
One could not exist without the other. Eternal Flow spent more than
ten years with the Teacher, leaving and returning about five times.
Initially, his departures were due to his inability to manage his own
mind. Later, they stemmed from his attempts to find independence.
Each return deepened his understanding, but the original error from
his celestial life resurfaced repeatedly. No amount of determination
or patience could resolve certain issues; some transformations
required time and lived experience. This was a natural process.</p>
<p>The Teacher favored instant transformation. His tools included
sharp corrections—both physical, such as strikes with a stick
designed to induce sudden &quot;enlightenment,&quot; and
psychological. On one hand, this allowed students to see themselves
in full and with startling clarity. On the other hand, it often led
to overwhelming psychological strain. The Teacher also outright
dismissed the significance of <em>forms,</em> which were central to
Eternal Flow’s understanding. To the Teacher, forms were irrelevant
because they encouraged a dualistic perspective—separating form
from essence—a more Western approach. Those inclined toward action
often divided process and content, while those predisposed to
contemplation saw the world as an inseparable whole, a distinctly
Eastern perspective. The Teacher insisted on practicing through
<em>awareness</em> and viewed results as the accumulation of energy.
Eternal Flow, rooted in traditional Eastern values, saw life as a
continuous transformation of energy. Their contrasting approaches
reflected a deeper divide: the methods they each followed were
fundamentally different. This clash mirrored the conflict Eternal
Flow had once had with the celestial order but was, at its core, a
struggle with himself. The Teacher was sent to Eternal Flow not to
impart technical skills, but to facilitate karmic resolution and
internal transformation. In fact, Eternal Flow often learned
technical aspects <em>in spite</em> of the Teacher’s instructions
rather than because of them. Teaching, after all, is a reciprocal
process. A true Teacher learns from their student as well. Eternal
Flow’s presence was, if not a challenge, a test for the Teacher—a
unique opportunity to refine his own mastery. While Eternal Flow
grappled with his karmic burdens, the Teacher, too, was engaged in a
process of growth. Together, they embodied the interplay of struggle
and transformation that lay at the heart of the &quot;true
tradition.&quot;</p>
<p>Karma can be considered resolved at the moment when the conflict
is fully exhausted. For Eternal Flow, this moment came with the
attainment of independence and the acceptance of complete
responsibility for his life. Naturally, this did not happen
overnight.</p>
<p>One day, Eternal Flow and his Teacher happened to meet by chance
on the street. Such encounters had occurred before and often served
as the catalyst for Eternal Flow's return to the Teacher. However,
this time, everything was different. Eternal Flow suddenly felt an
indescribable joy. In the past, he had felt either shame, regret, or
like a beaten dog. A conversation began, which, for the first time,
was simply a dialogue between two people, without the social roles of
Teacher and Student being involved. They rode on a trolleybus,
discussing life, the path, and martial arts. Eternal Flow had
previously expressed outright disagreement with the Teacher’s
statements, but now it was a healthy, lively debate, rooted in a
sincere desire to uncover the truth by accepting and learning from
each other’s experiences.</p>
<p>As long as Eternal Flow sought the Teacher's approval, he met only
criticism and reprimands. But now, while perhaps not entirely secure,
he was standing on his own two feet and was no longer trying to prove
anything. He already knew the answer to the final question he planned
to ask the Teacher, and he asked it not so much to double-check
himself, but out of gratitude. By doing so, he conveyed that despite
all the significant disagreements they had had over the years, he had
understood the most important thing. This essential truth could not
be expressed in words—it pertained to a very specific inner <em>effort</em>.
Eternal Flow already knew that the Teacher could sense this effort
and quietly rejoiced within. Mastering this effort was the outcome of
his training, the sign of having successfully passed the exam of
karma.</p>
<p>Eternal Flow asked:<br/>
— Tell me, have I become more morally
resilient?<br/>
— Yes, — came the reply.</p>
<h3 class="western" align="center">Transformation</h3>
<p>They never met again. The desire to reach out to the Teacher arose
in Eternal Flow's heart many times after their last encounter and
still occasionally does. It is not the desire to receive a specific
answer, nor even the wish to dispel the inner tension that any
question inevitably brings. Instead, it is the longing to seek
support during difficult moments. True spiritual maturity is the
realization that the one you seek support from is already yourself
and that you have nowhere to draw it from but within. Through his
time under the Teacher’s guidance, Eternal Flow found an anchor
within himself. He now clearly saw his nature—its strengths, its
weaknesses, and the direction of his path. He no longer harbored the
childish desire to &quot;become a Buddha and never be reborn again.&quot;
Eternal Flow could no longer afford such naivety because he had to
face the complex challenges of daily life, which continually tested
his nature.</p>
<p>Earthly existence cares nothing for the reasons why a being ends
up in it. This world was created by those who prioritize action over
perception and place greater importance on creating new forms than on
using existing ones to return to the Original Void. Humanity
perceives development as outward movement, an expression of ceaseless
expansion. For a long time, Eternal Flow genuinely believed this was
a matter of free will, but it is merely the outcome of the
realization of their nature. Gods cannot help but create worlds,
humans cannot help but build social systems and struggle for power.
They will never understand that exchanging their Density for a high,
stable salary in a major corporation robs them of the ability to live
freely, yet they cannot be judged for this. There exist four
immeasurable qualities of the heart, each enabling the acceptance of
the present state of things: love, joy, compassion, and equanimity.
One loves when one wishes to become like those they admire; one
rejoices when one simply <em>is</em>, having recognized their true
nature; one shows compassion if they have been in the same position
but have since freed themselves from illusions; and finally, one
exhibits equanimity when one transcends the struggle of opposites.
These immeasurable qualities are not a matter of free will but
exclusively an expression of a person’s natural essence. There is
no wrong nature; there is only a nature we cannot or do not want to
understand.</p>
<p>Humility is not the heroic gritting of teeth; it is the sincere
realization of the inevitability of destiny. Destiny is predetermined
because the character that shapes it is preordained. Character is
predetermined because the habits defining it are unchanging. Habits
are unchanging because the actions that form them stem from natural
essence, and natural essence is the original, predetermined given
with which we live through many lifetimes. Thus, destiny does not
contradict free will; it is merely its projection. Only by fully
accepting one's destiny can one attain true freedom.</p>
